# this too shall pass (telephone on a plinth)
Sound sculpture installation @ Gallery 46, Whitechapel, London (9th-12th February 2023)

-------------------------

This is an interactive work that repurposes a 1950s Bell Manufacturing Company telephone to engage with the perceptive process of change.

The work aims to cultivate a self-reflexive mode of attention, by displacing sound in time and subjecting it to a recursive disintegration that foregrounds the listener’s experience of and relationship to the dissolution of sounds that have recently passed through echoic memory.

By codifying the experience of impermanence into a subjective event, the possibility for a non-conceptual metacognitive engagement with the perceptive process of change arises, something akin to what Henri Bergson has described as interfacing with the flow of duration (2014).

It uses a Bela board (https://bela.io/) with an HC-SR04 proximity sensor, force sensing resistor, electret mic and 2 small speaker cones.
